How It Works
A GitHub sign-in page is a replica or inspired design that mimics the GitHub login interface, focusing on the layout and styling.

Structure (HTML): The page uses HTML to create the structure, including a form with input fields for the username or email and password, along with a "Sign in" button. Additional elements like links for "Forgot password?" and "Create an account" are added for realism.
Styling (CSS): CSS is used to style the page, making it visually appealing and responsive. This includes defining the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing to align with GitHub's theme. Elements like padding, margins, alignment, and hover effects enhance user interaction.
Responsiveness: While your version may be static, adding media queries can make the design responsive for different devices.


Steps to Make It

HTML:

Create the skeleton of the page with DOCTYPE, meta tags, and a <title>.
Add a container <div> for all the elements.
Add an <h1> for the title.
Use <form> to include labeled input fields for username/email and password.
Add a submit button and links for "Forgot password?" and "Create an account."


CSS:

Apply global styles like font-family, background color, and layout alignment using flexbox.
Style the form fields, button, and links for consistency and to mimic GitHub's appearance.
Add hover effects to buttons and links for interactivity.
Enhancements:

Use vh, em, % for flexible layout scaling.
Add CSS transitions for smooth hover effects.
Include media queries for responsiveness (optional).
Test:

Test the design in a browser to ensure it looks good.
Debug any alignment or responsiveness issues.
