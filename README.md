# 🔐 GitHub Sign-In Page (Clone)

This project is a **replica of GitHub's login interface**, created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's a static design built to practice frontend layout and styling, with a focus on UI cloning.

---

## 📌 How It Works

A GitHub sign-in page clone is a static UI design that mimics the real GitHub login screen. The goal of this project is to practice front-end structuring, layout design, and CSS styling skills by recreating a popular interface.

---

## 🏗️ Structure (HTML)

The HTML structure includes:

- A `<form>` containing:
  - Input field for **Username or Email**
  - Input field for **Password**
  - A **"Sign in"** button
- Links for:
  - **Forgot password?**
  - **Create an account**
- A `<div>` container wraps all elements with appropriate headings and labels.

---

## 🎨 Styling (CSS)

The CSS includes:

- Clean, minimal layout using **Flexbox** for alignment
- GitHub-style color scheme, fonts, padding, and spacing
- Styled form inputs, buttons, and links
- Hover effects for buttons and links to improve interactivity

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

While the base version is static, CSS properties like:

- `vh`, `em`, and `%` units
- `flexbox` layout
- Optional **media queries**

...can make the design adaptable for different screen sizes.
