How It Works
A GitHub sign-in page is a replica or inspired design that mimics the GitHub login interface, focusing on the layout and styling.

Structure (HTML): The page uses HTML to create the structure, including a form with input fields for the username or email and password, along with a "Sign in" button. Additional elements like links for "Forgot password?" and "Create an account" are added for realism.
Styling (CSS): CSS is used to style the page, making it visually appealing and responsive. This includes defining the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing to align with GitHub's theme. Elements like padding, margins, alignment, and hover effects enhance user interaction.
Responsiveness: While your version may be static, adding media queries can make the design responsive for different devices.
